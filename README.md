# Code-Portfolio
Hi! My name is Dillon Goicoechea, and this is my code portfolio!
I am a third-year Honors Computer Science and Engineering student at Seattle Pacific University.

This code is a mix of personal projects I did in my free time and academic projects I was very passionate about!

The src folder is a calculator web application mad with Vue.js . This was my first framework application with JavaScript, and it was a fun learning experience. It was much different than using node.js and JavaScript without a framework!

Main.js is a dynamic web-page I programmed while refreshing on JavaScript before taking Net-centric computing! It is very simple, but a fun refresher.

EmployeeData.cpp and dlinkedlist.cpp are C++ code from my Data Structures courses creating a Double Linked List class and using class objects to generate reports!

ReadCSV.CPP is a C++ program I developed for my Data Structures course to read data from a csv to a format easily used for creating class objects to generate data reports.

Now for my favorite assignment that falls into my passion of computer science: The Rust compiler, comprising of files Main.rs, Test0.sc, and Rust README if you want specific details of the rules of the assignment.
I spent upwards of 30 hours on this assignment, designing, programming, redesigning, refactoring, and optimizing my code for this project. I study compiler design and engineering as a hobby, and this assignment brought out the love of the topic in me. This project is the reason I love Rust as a programming language, and I truly believe it is the new C++. I could drone on about this project, but I imagine you do not want that, but please contact me if you want to know more!
